# About

This repository is **a supplement** to the Andrew Wolf's [**Machine Learning For Everyone**](ml4everyone.com) book - an A-Z guide to the world of Data Science. This supplement contains the implementation of algorithms, statistical methods and techniques (in Python) that were described in the book. The structure of the repository is identical to the structure of the book:

1. [**Chapter 1. Basic Principles**](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/tree/master/Chapter%201.%20Basic%20Principles)
    - [`intro.ipynb`](www.google.com) : *introduction to Python*
    - [`cross_validation_methods.ipynb`](www.google.com) : *Hold-out, k-Fold, Leave-One-Out, Leave-p-Out*
2. [**Chapter 2. Machine Learning Fundamentals**](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/tree/master/Chapter%202.%20Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals)
    - [`algorithms_and_how_they_work.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%202.%20Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/algorithms_and_how_they_work.ipynb) : *cost functions, gradient descent*
    - [`errors.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%202.%20Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/errors.ipynb) : *bias and variance graphs, training and test errors graph, learning and validation curves*
3. [**Chapter 3. Data Preprocessing**](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/tree/master/Chapter%203.%20Data%20Preprocessing)
    - [`data_cleaning.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%203.%20Data%20Preprocessing/data_cleaning.ipynb) : *fixing incorrect data, incomplete data, irrelevant data, duplicated data, improperly formatted data*
    - [`feature_engineering.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%203.%20Data%20Preprocessing/feature_engineering.ipynb) : *feature transformation, feature generation*
    - [`data_normalization_standardization.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%203.%20Data%20Preprocessing/data_normalization_standardization.ipynb) : *normalization, standardization*
    - [`data_augmentation.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%203.%20Data%20Preprocessing/data_augmentation.ipynb) : *synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)*
4. [**Chapter 4. Feature Selection Techniques**](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/tree/master/Chapter%204.%20Feature%20Selection%20Techniques)
    - [`embedded_methods.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%204.%20Feature%20Selection%20Techniques/embedded_methods.ipynb) : *decision tree classifier, lasso regression*
    - [`filter_methods.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%204.%20Feature%20Selection%20Techniques/filter_methods.ipynb) : *chi-square, fisher score, relief, correlation-based feature selection*
    - [`wrapper_methods.ipynb`](https://github.com/5x12/ml4everyone/blob/master/Chapter%204.%20Feature%20Selection%20Techniques/wrapper_methods.ipynb) : *step forward feature selection, step backward feature selection, recursive feature elimination*
